# FirebaseLogin App

This app uses Firebase Authentication to allow a login with a Facebook account. Once the user is loged, a button to create a new client is shown.
The second screen, in which the user can create a new client, shows a couple of attributes for this new client (like name, lastname, age and birthdate). Once all the data is filled, the client could be saved into a Firebase Realtime Database by clickin on the "Guardar" button.
